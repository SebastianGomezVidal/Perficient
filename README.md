## CHALLENGE
Using the following API Definition: 

https://petstore.swagger.io/#/

Create a collection with two requests:
1. Create a Pet, create tests to verify it was created successfully.
2. Get a Pet, create tests to verify you're getting the expected pet.
3. Place an order for the created Pet.
4. Get the order created in step 3, and verify it has the expected data.
5. Automate it using newman.

Hint: You will probably need to use environments to store some data that needs to be shared between requests.

Upload the solution to a repo, put in the README instructions about how to execute your code, share the solution as a response to this message :)
